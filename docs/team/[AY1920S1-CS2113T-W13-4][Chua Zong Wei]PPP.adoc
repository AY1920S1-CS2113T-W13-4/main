== About the project
My team was tasked with enhancing a basic command line interface based task scheduling application called Duke. To satisfy
our project requirements, we chose the morph the application into DIYeats, a dietary management software that allows users to
plan out their diet with ease. Additionally, our application is also capable of suggesting meals and exercise plans that are customized
to every user based on their BMI, providing them with a personalized user experience that caters specifically to them.

My primary role in the object was to design and write the code for the `add`, `setgoal` and `suggestexercise` commands. The following
sections will help illustrate these enhancements in more detail, as well as the relevant documentation I have added to the
user and developer guides in relation to these enhancements.

Additionally, the following annotations will be used throughout this user guide:

== Summary of contributions
The following section summarizes the contributions I have made to the coding and documentation of my team project

**Enhancement added:**

.  `add` command: I added the ability to set default nutritional values to food names
* *What it does*: The `add` command allows the user to assign default nutritional values to a food name. The user
   may rewrite these default values by re-entering the `add` command with the same food name.
* *Justification*: In the course of populating their diet plan, users may come across certain food items that need to be entered
   repetitively across the entire plan. For example, if they have "bread" everyday for breakfast it becomes a chore to type the name
   of the item repeatedly, along with its associated nutritional values. With the `add` command, the user simply has to assign
   default nutritional values to "bread" once, and from then on he/she can simply enter "bread", and the system will automatically
   assign the default nutritional values assigned with "bread" to the meal. This expedites user input.
* *Highlights*: This enhancement works in tandem with our plan to include all the meal items at the NUS Deck canteen into our application.
. `setgoal` command: I added the ability for the user to set a dietary goal to be met by a deadline
* *What it does*: The `setgoal` command allows the user to set a goal to be met by a deadline(e.g: losing weight). With
   a goal set, the software can generate meaningful data that will allow the user to reach their dietary goals.
* *Justification*: Sometimes, the user may find themselves consuming too many or too little calories to maintain a healthy
   lifestyle. By allowing the user to set a target for themselves, it will keep them on track for their dietary plan, and allow the software
   to suggest and plan a meal and exercise schedule for the user that caters to their specific needs.
* *Highlights* : This enhancement works in tandem and is core in the implementation of the `suggestmeals` and `suggestexercise` command.
. `suggestexercise` command (Major): I added the ability for the software to automatically suggest an exercise plan for the user
* *What it does* Once the user has set a goal to be met using the `setgoal` command, the `suggestexercise` will automatically
  suggest an exercise regime that aligns with the user's goals.
* *Justification* When the user is following a strict dietary plan, it becomes difficult to calculate exactly how much exercise is required to lose weight,
  and how much exercise is too much and unhealthy for the body. With the `suggestexercise` command, the software will automatically
  formulate a suitable exercise regime for the user that aligns with their goals.

== Contributions to the User Guide
We had to update our original User Guide with instructions for the enhancements that
we had added. The following is an excerpt from our DIYeats User Guide, showing additions that I have
made for the features and command sections.

**Features**

In this section, you will be introduced to the various command formats that will be used in *DIYeats*, along with their associated syntax.

[TIP]
====
Don't worry if you don't understand the usage of the commands at a glance.
Examples will be provided to aid in your understanding of the commands.
====
====
*Command Format*

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.
**  For example, the command `add n/ MEAL` can be entered as the following:
.. `add n/ burger`
.. `add n/ fries`
.. `add n/ burger and fries`
** But not:
.. `add n/{nbsp}` (The user defined field is empty)
* Fields in square brackets `[]` are optional, and can be omitted from the input statement if unnecessary
** For example, `n/ MEAL [t/ TAG]` can be entered as:
.. `n/ burger t/ calories`
.. `n/ fries t/ sodium`
.. `n/ burger`
* Fields in arrow brackets `<>` are required after its preceding  optional tag
** For example, `[t/ TAG]` `<QUANTITY>` can be entered as:
.. `t/ calories` `100`
.. `t/ sodium` `10`
.. `{nbsp}` (The optional tag is not present)
** But not:
.. `t/calories` `{nbsp}` (The required user defined field is empty)
* Fields with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times
** For example, `[t/ TAG]...` can be entered as:
.. `{nbsp}` (i.e. 0 times)
.. `t/ calories`
.. `t/ calcium t/ sodium`,  etc.
====

[WARNING]
====
* Commands demonstrated in the user guide only accept numerical inputs in the *integer format*, unless otherwise stated
** For example, `20` should be entered instead of `twenty` when trying to input a number
* Parameter values should not be *empty or negative* (unless otherwise stated).
* All commands to be entered in the CLI should be proceeded with the kbd:[Enter] key,
====

Now that you have familiarized yourself with the command syntax that will be used, lets move on to the actual commands that can be used in *DIYeats*!

**Commands**

*Listing nutritional intake for the day: `list`*

Format: `list [/date] <DATE>`

Want to view your current nutritional intake for today? Simply enter the command `list` to show your current recorded nutritional intake for breakfast, lunch and dinner.

The command also supports the viewing of data from other dates: simply specify the date after adding a `/date` flag.

Examples:

* You want to view your data today:
** `list`
* You want to view your data from 26th of December, 2019:
** `list /date 26/12/2019`
* You want to view your data from 1st of January, 2018:
** `list /date 1/1/2018`

[NOTE]
====
* Current date is obtained from the system date in your computer.
* Dates should be entered in the following format: day/month/year.
====

*Adding a breakfast item: `breakfast`*

Format: `breakfast DESCRIPTION [/TAG]<QUANTITY>... [/date] <DATE>`

Want to add a breakfast item with its associated nutritional information? Use the `breakfast` command!

The command also supports the addition of data to other dates: simply specify the date after adding a `/date` flag at the end of the statement

Examples:

* You ate a hamburger today, but you are unsure of its nutritional value:
** `breakfast hamburger`
* You ate a hamburger that had 1000 calories and 10 grams of sodium worth in salt
** `breakfast hamburger /calories 1000 /sodium 10`
* You ate a hamburger that had 1000 calories and 10 grams of sodium worth in salt on 1st of January, 2019, but you are only adding the item today
** `breakfast hamburger /calories 1000 /sodium 10 /date 1/1/2019`

[NOTE]
====
* Current date is obtained from the system date in your computer.
* Dates should be entered in the following format: day/month/year.
====

*Adding a lunch item: `lunch`*

Format: `lunch DESCRIPTION [/TAG]<QUANTITY>... [/date] <DATE>`

Want to add a lunch item with its associated nutritional information? Use the `lunch` command!

The command also supports the addition of data to other dates: simply specify the date after adding a `/date` flag at the end of the statement

Examples:

* You ate a hamburger today, but you are unsure of its nutritional value:

== Contributions to Developer Guide

We had to update our original Developer Guide with instructions for the enhancements that we had added. The following is an excerpt from our DIYeats developer Guide, showing additions that I have made for the Design section, as well as the Add command in the implementation section.

*Design*

*Architecture*

.Architecture Diagram
image::architecture.png[width="500"]

The figure above illustrates how our program might look like from a high-level perspective. Each of the major processes in the figure above will be elaborated on in the following sections.

`Main` has one function `run` which is executed immediately when the program is run. This function is responsible for:

* At application launch: initialize the UI, Model, Storage and Logic components of the code in the correct sequence

* During application runtime: support high level exchange of information between each of the aforementioned component

* At shutdown: Stop all running processes, and initiate any cleanup methods whenever required

*Model*

.Model Diagram : Meal Management
image::model.png[width="800"]

The Model component of the code is in charge of tracking and managing all of the meal data involved during the application's runtime. It accomplishes this by:

* Initializing a MealList object, which stores:
** All of the user's meal info
** All of the previously defined default meal values
* Initializing a Goal object, which stores the user defined dietary targets to be met.
* Being capable of operating independently of all the other code components.

.Model Diagram: Cost Management
image::transactionmodel.png[width="800"]

The Model component of the code is in charge of managing the transaction data involved during the application's runtime. It accomplishes this by:

* Initializing a TransactionList object, which stores
** All of the transactions information (e.g. transaction amount, dates of transaction).
* Being capable of operating independently of all the other code components.

*Storage*

.Storage Diagram
image::storage.png[width="800"]

The storage component of the code is in charge of reading and writing to files in the Data package of the main program directory. it accomplishes this by:

* Initializing a Load object, which:
** Is capable of reading and parsing data from the text save files in the Data directory, using its constituent functions as well as subsidiary classes.
** Being capable of operating independently of all the other code components.
* Initializing a Write object, which:
** Is capable of writing data to the text save files in the Data directory, using its constituent functions.
** Being capable of operating independently of all the other code components.

*Logic*

.Logic Diagram
image::logic.png[width="800"]

The Logic component of the code is in charge of parsing all of the user's commands and executing them. It accomplishes this in the following steps:

. The UI receives a command from the user, and sends it over to the Logic component
. The Parser object in the Logic component receives the command, and calls the autocorrect function to correct any typo errors present in the command
. The corrected command is inserted in the commandHistory
. Depending on the type of command issued, the parser calls the commandparser associated with the command, which parses the command into its relevant data chunks.
. A command object relevant to the user given command is then instantiated from the data in the user given command
. The command object is then passed to the main function, which immediately executes it

*Ui*

The Ui component of the code is in charge of:

. Executing all user commands through the Logic component
. Presenting data from the model component of the code to the user through the command line interface

**Add command**

The Add feature gives the user the ability to assign default nutritional values associated with certain meal names.

This section describes the implementation and design considerations involved in the Add feature, and how the Add feature expedites user input.

**Current implementation**

Assuming that there are no preexisting default values assigned to meals, and the user inputs the `add` command `add hotcakes /calories 300`, the application processes the command through the following steps:

. The `Main` class calls the parse function of the `Parser` class to parse the user input.

. After parsing, the data is then used to create an instance of the `AddItemCommand` object, which is then returned to the `Main` function.
. The `Main` function would then invoke the `AddItemCommand#execute()` function.
. The `AddItemCommand#execute()` function then further invokes the `MealList#addStoredItem(...)` function, which stores the data in a `storedItems` object of type `HashMap<String, HashMap<String, Integer>>`, in the following format:
* The key of the encapsulating hashmap is the name of the meal that is to be assigned default values, in this instance, it has only one member `hotcakes`
* The internal hashmap associated with the key `hotcakes` is used to store the nutritional tags (e.g calories, sodium, etc.), along with the default quantity associated with it. In this case, the internal hashmap only has one key `calories`, which is associated with the integer value `300`

The steps carried out by the program as described above are captured in figure 5, the sequence diagram as shown below.

.Add command sequence diagram
image::addcommand.png[width="800"]

**Design considerations**

Problem 1: *How to store the data associated with this command*

* Solution 1 (current implementation): Hashmap of a Hashmap
** By storing the data in this format, this feature can be easily extendable to store multiple different default values associated to different nutritional tags to a single meal. Additionally, read and write access can be carried out in approximately O(n) time, where n is the amount of nutritional tags associated to a single meal. As n is unlikely to be large (n > 10), the process is not time complex.

Problem 2: *Where to instantiate the data structure used to store the data for this command*

* Solution 1 (current implementation): Directly in the MealList data structure
** By instantiating the data structure directly in the MealList data structure, it becomes straightforward to access the data whenever a new meal is added.
** However, this violates the separation of concerns architecture principle
* Solution 2 (planned implementation by v1.3): In a separate class
** By instantiating the data structure in a different class, it improves the cohesion of the code, and satisfies the separation of concerns principle
