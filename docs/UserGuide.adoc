== Features

In this section, you will be introduced to the various command formats that will be used in *DIYeats*, along with their associated syntax.

[TIP]
====
Don't worry if you don't understand the usage of the commands at a glance.
Examples will be provided to aid in your understanding of the commands.
====
====
*Command Format*

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.
**  For example, the command `add n/ MEAL` can be entered as the following:
.. `add n/ burger`
.. `add n/ fries`
.. `add n/ burger and fries`
** But not:
.. `add n/{nbsp}` (The user defined field is empty)
* Fields in square brackets `[]` are optional, and can be omitted from the input statement if unnecessary
** For example, `n/ MEAL [t/ TAG]` can be entered as:
.. `n/ burger t/ calories`
.. `n/ fries t/ sodium`
.. `n/ burger`
* Fields in arrow brackets `<>` are required after its preceding  optional tag
** For example, `[t/ TAG]` `<QUANTITY>` can be entered as:
.. `t/ calories` `100`
.. `t/ sodium` `10`
.. `{nbsp}` (The optional tag is not present)
** But not:
.. `t/calories` `{nbsp}` (The required user defined field is empty)
* Fields with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times
 ** For example, `[t/ TAG]...` can be entered as:
 .. `{nbsp}` (i.e. 0 times)
 .. `t/ calories`
 .. `t/ calcium t/ sodium`,  etc.
====

[WARNING]
====
* Commands demonstrated in the user guide only accept numerical inputs in the *integer format*, unless otherwise stated
** For example, `20` should be entered instead of `twenty` when trying to input a number
* Parameter values should not be *empty or negative* (unless otherwise stated).
* All commands to be entered in the CLI should be proceeded with the kbd:[Enter] key,

====
==== Locating a meal by keyword: `find`

====

====

Examples:

[NOTE]
====
* Marked done the task at the specified `INDEX`.
* The index refers to the index number shown in the displayed tasklist.
* The index *must be a positive integer* (1, 2, 3, ...) and must not go out of bound of the list of meals.
* Only meals that have been eaten are counted to the calories you have eaten that day.
* Only meals that have been marked done will deduct the account balance.
* Marking done meal that has been eaten would not do anything.
* If the food cost exceeds the account balance remaining, the meal will not be marked done.
====

Examples (assuming initial account balance is 10SGD):

* `done 2` +

==== Adding/modifying default values to a meal: `default`

Format: `default DESCRIPTION [/TAG]<QUANTITY>...`

nutritional values for food items that have the same description.

Examples:

* `default Mega Zinger burger /calories 1100` +
This will assign the default values of 1100 calories to food items that have the name "Mega Zinger burger"
** Next time when you enter a meal item, say `lunch Mega Zinger burger`, it will already have the 1100 calories associated with it
+
image::Add_Command_1.png[]

[NOTE]
====
* Only one set of default values can exist for every name of a meal
* To override the existing defaults, simply run another default command with the same name, or override the existing
tag within the `breakfast`, `lunch` or `dinner` command.
* Assigning default values to a meal will also make DIYeats able to suggest it the next time you use the suggestmeal command
====

==== Deleting default values to a meal: `deldefault`

Format: `deldefault DESCRIPTION`

Need to delete a previously assigned default value? Use the `deldefault` command, followed by the name of the default value to be deleted.

Examples:

* There is a default value associated with `Mega Zinger burger`, and you wish to remove it.

+
image::Del_Default_1.png[]
* You want to delete a default value associated with `burger`, but you are not exactly sure whats the exact name of the meal.
** `deldefault burger`
+
image::Del_Default_2.png[]

** Say you want to delete fish burger, enter `1`
+
image::Del_Default_3.png[]

==== Add suggestable exercise: `addexercise`

Format: `addexercise DESCRIPTION /value MET`

Want to add a custom exercise regimen to the suggestexercise command? Use the `addexercise` command, followed by a description
of the exercises routine, and its MET value after a /value tag.

[TIP]
====
MET stands for "one metabolic unit" at rest. Thus if an exercise is five times as energy burning as what you do at rest,
it would be five METs.
====

Examples:

* You want a "sprinting" exercise routine worth 23 METs.
** `addexercise sprinting /value 23`
+

* You want a "Rock climbing" exercise routine worth 10 METs.
** `addexercise Rock climbing /value 10`
+

[NOTE]
====
* MET value cannot be negative, or lower than 1 (no activity should cause you to lose less energy than doing nothing)
* There cannot be two suggestable exercises with exactly the same name. The new one will override the older entry's MET value.
====

==== Deleting a suggestable exercise: `delexercise`

Format: `delexercise DESCRIPTION`

Need to delete a suggestable exercise routine? Use the `delexercise` command, followed by the description of the exercise routine to be deleted.
