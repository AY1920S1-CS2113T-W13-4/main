== Introduction

*DIYeats* is an application designed to help NUS students plan out their diet in order to maintain a healthy lifestyle,
which can often times be a challenging endeavour amidst the intense academic rigour associated with university life.

*DIYeats* utilizes a command line interface, and is compatible with most modern OSes
(Windows, Macintosh, Linux, Ubuntu). Commands are designed to be simple and intuitive, such that even users who are
unfamiliar with the command line interface can use it with ease.

*DIYeats* also comes with a Graphical User Interface. Which will allow even users who are not familiar with the command
interface to use our application.

In this section, you will be introduced to the various command formats that will be used in *DIYeats*, along with their associated syntax.

[TIP]
====

*Command Format*

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.
**  For example, the command `add n/ MEAL` can be entered as the following:
.. `add n/ burger`
.. `add n/ fries`
.. `add n/ burger and fries`
** But not:
.. `add n/{nbsp}` (The user defined field is empty)
* Fields in square brackets `[]` are optional, and can be omitted from the input statement if unnecessary
** For example, `n/ MEAL [t/ TAG]` can be entered as:
.. `n/ burger t/ calories`
.. `n/ fries t/ sodium`
.. `n/ burger`
* Fields in arrow brackets `<>` are required after its preceding  optional tag
** For example, `[t/ TAG]` `<QUANTITY>` can be entered as:
.. `t/ calories` `100`
.. `t/ sodium` `10`
.. `{nbsp}` (The optional tag is not present)
** But not:
.. `t/calories` `{nbsp}` (The required user defined field is empty)
* Fields with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times
 ** For example, `[t/ TAG]...` can be entered as:
 .. `{nbsp}` (i.e. 0 times)
 .. `t/ calories`
 .. `t/ calcium t/ sodium`,  etc.
====

[WARNING]
====
* Commands demonstrated in the user guide only accept numerical inputs in the *integer format*, unless otherwise stated
** For example, `20` should be entered instead of `twenty` when trying to input a number
* Parameter values should not be *empty or negative* (unless otherwise stated).
* All commands to be entered in the CLI should be proceeded with the kbd:[Enter] key,
