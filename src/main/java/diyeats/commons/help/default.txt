Adding/modifying default values to a meal.

    default DESCRIPTION [/TAG\<QUANTITY>...

For Example:

1. You want to assign the default values of 1100 calories to food items that have the name "Mega Zinger burger"

    default Mega Zinger burger /calories 1100

Note:
- Only one set of default values can exist for every name of meal
- To override the existing defaults, simply run another default command with the same name,
or override the existing tag within the breakfast, lunch, dinner command.
- Assigning default values to a meal will also make DIYeats able to
suggest it the next time you use the suggestmeal command.
- THis functio does not suppoer addition of default cost. Doing so will treat "cost" as the name of a nutrient, and
will not update actual cost of the meal.
