Setting a nutritional goal to be met : `setgoal`

Format: `setgoal /start START_DATE /end END_DATE /activity ACTIVITY /weight WEIGHT`

TIP:
- This command is a prerequisite for many other features in the application. Please try to set this up as soon as possible
  to enjoy the full capabilities of our application.

Want to set a nutritional goal to be met at the end of a set timeframe, e.g: consuming at most a certain amount of
calories worth of foods by the end of the month? Use the `setgoal` command!

NOTE:
* Dates should be entered in the following format: dd/mm/yyyy.
* Activity level is a range between 1 to 5 inclusive, from 1 being sedentary to 5 being very active.
* The command will only accept activity levels that are higher or equal to the activity level indicated during user setup.

WARNING:

* All parameters specified in the format must be specified, or the command will be rendered invalid.
* Unrealistic weight loss goals will be discarded (e.g. trying to lose more than 40% of static calorie expenditure per day).
* Updating weight to a value that renders the set goal unrealistic will cause the goal to be discarded next time the
  application is loaded.
