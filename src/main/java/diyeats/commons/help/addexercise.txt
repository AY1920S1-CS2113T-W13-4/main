Add suggestable exercise

    addexercise DESCRIPTION /value MET

For example:

1. You want a "sprinting" exercise routine worth 23 METs.

    addexercise sprinting /value 23

2. You want a "Rock climbing" exercise routine worth 10 METs.

    addexercise Rock climbing /value 10

Note:
- MET value cannot be negative, or lower than 1 (no activity should cause you to lose less energy than doing nothing)
- There cannot be two suggestable exercises with exactly the same name. The new one will override the older entryâ€™s MET value.
