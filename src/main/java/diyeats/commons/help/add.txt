Create or modify a default values for a food item.
You can set default nutritional values for food items that have the same description.

Format: `default DESCRIPTION [/TAG]<QUANTITY>...`

Tired of entering the same nutritional values for a recurring dish repeatedly? By using the `default` command, you can set default
nutritional values for food items that have the same description.

Examples:

`default Mega Zinger burger /calories 1100`
This will assign the default values of 1100 calories to food items that have the name "Mega Zinger burger"
Next time when you enter a meal item, say `lunch Mega Zinger burger`, it will already have the 1100 calories associated with it
