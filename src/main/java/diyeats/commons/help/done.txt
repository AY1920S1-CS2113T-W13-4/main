Mark a meal as done and updating the account balance.

    done INDEX [/date] <DATE>

For Example:

1. You want to mark the 2nd meal on today's list as done

    done 2

2. You want to mark the 3rd meal on 1/1/2019 as done

    done 3 /date 1/1/2019

Note:

- Marked done the task at the specified INDEX
- The index refers to the index number shown in the displayed tasklist
- The index must be a positive integer (1,2,3, ...) and must not go out of bound of the list of meals.
- Only meals that have been eaten are counted to the calories you have eaten that day.
- Only meals that have been marked done will deduct the account balance.
- Marking done meal that has been eaten would not do anything.
- If the food cost exceeds the account balance remaining, the meal will not be marked done.
